This is an experimental C library implementing arbitrary-precision ball arithmetic on top of FLINT (http://flintlib.org/). Planned future additions include more functions, complex numbers, polynomial balls, and matrix balls. When the code stabilizes, it might get merged back into FLINT.

The build scripts are copied from FLINT and were written by Bill Hart.
