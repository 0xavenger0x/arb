Arb is an experimental C library implementing arbitrary-precision ball
arithmetic, polynomials and matrices on top of FLINT (http://flintlib.org/).
The project might get merged back into FLINT when the code
stabilizes in the future.

For documentation and additional details, see: http://fredrikj.net/arb/

Development updates are occasionally posted to: http://fredrikj.net/blog/

Author: Fredrik Johansson <fredrik.johansson@gmail.com>

The build scripts are copied from FLINT and were written by Bill Hart.
