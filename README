This is an experimental C library implementing arbitrary-precision ball arithmetic on top of FLINT (http://flintlib.org/). Planned future additions include more functions, complex numbers, polynomial balls, and matrix balls. When the code stabilizes, it might get merged back into FLINT.

For documentation and additional details, see: http://fredrikj.net/arb/doc.html

The build scripts are copied from FLINT and were written by Bill Hart.
