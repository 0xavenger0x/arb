2015-12-29 - version 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Compatibility and build system

  * Added acb_quadratic_roots_fmpz.
  * Improved arb_sinh to use a more accurate formula for x < 0.
  * Added sinc function (arb_sinc) (contributed by Alex Griffing).
  * Fixed bug in arb_exp affecting convergence for huge input.
  * Faster implementation of arb_div_2expm1_ui.
  * Added mag_root, mag_geom_series.
  * Improved and added test code for arb_add_error functions.
  * Changed arb_pow and acb_pow to make pow(0,positive) = 0 instead of nan.
  * Improved acb_sqrt to return finite output for finite input straddling the branch cut.
  * Improved arb_set_interval_arf so that [inf,inf] = inf instead of an infinite interval.
  * Added computation of Bell numbers (arb_bell_fmpz).
  * Added arb_power_sum_vec for computing power sums using Bernoulli numbers.
  * Added computation of the Fujiwara root bound for acb_poly.
  * Added code to identify all the real roots of a real polynomial (acb_poly_validate_real_roots).

  * Added missing functions acb_add_si, acb_sub_si.
  * Renamed arb_root to arb_root_ui (keeping alias) and added acb_root_ui.

* Special functions

  * Implemented the Gauss hypergeometric function 2F1 and its regularized version.
  * Fixed two bugs in acb_hypgeom_pfq_series_direct discovered while implementing 2F1. In rare cases, these could lead to incorrect values for functions depending on parameter derivatives of hypergeometric series.

    * The first bug involved incorrect handling of negative integer parameters. The bug only affected 2F1 and higher functions; it did not affect correctness of any previously implemented functions that relied on acb_hypgeom_pfq_series_direct (such as Bessel Y and K functions of integer order).
    * The second bug involved a too small bound being computed for the sum of a geometric series. The geometric series bound is nearly tight for 2F1, and the incorrect version caused immediate test failures for that function. Theoretically, this bug affected correctness of some previously-implemented functions that relied on acb_hypgeom_pfq_series_direct (such as Bessel Y and K functions of integer order), but since the geometric bound is not as tight in those cases, those functions were still reliable in practice (no failing test case has been found).

  * Fixed erf to give finite values instead of +/-inf for big imaginary input.
  * Improved acb_zeta (and arb_zeta) to automatically use fast code for integer zeta values.
  * Added double factorial (arb_doublefac_ui).
  * Added code for generating Hilbert class polynomials (acb_modular_hilbert_class_poly).
